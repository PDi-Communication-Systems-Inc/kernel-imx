[Authenticate Data]
# This covers the Kernel, Ramdisk and Device Tree (second image)
# Blocks have the following definition:
#    Image block start address on i.MX, Offset from start of image file,
#    Length of block in bytes, image data file
# example
# 0x14008000 = Kernel start address in DDR (base + offset)
# 0x0 = Kernel starting index in file to sign
# 0x669640 = Length of Kernel (data to sign)
# boot.img-kernel = Kernel data file to generate signature against
# 0x15000000 = Ramdisk start address in DDR
# 0x0 = Ramdisk starting index in file to sign
# 0x7A020 = Length of Ramdisk (data to sign = ramdisk + padding + ivt_size)
# boot.img-ramdisk.gz-pad-ivt = Ramdisk data file to generate signature against
# 0x14F00000 = Second boot image start address in DDR (device tree blob)
# 0x0 = Second image starting index in file to sign
# 0xC65E = Length of Second image
# boot.img-second.gz = Second boot image data file to generate signature against
